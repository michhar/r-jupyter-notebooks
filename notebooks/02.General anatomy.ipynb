    "5.  Cell type defaults to <b>Code</b>.  You can change this to <b>Markdown</b> if you want to take notes (markdown is it's own language for which you can find [guides](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html)). Markdown is what all the text here is written in, so double click on this text to see the raw markdown.  Also, for whatever reason you can embed any <font color = \"red\">html</font> you want (good way to include pics).  Aaaaaand, LaTeX equations seem to render just fine (tables not so much...).\n",
